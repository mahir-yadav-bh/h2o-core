            <h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>

            <p>
                Water is essential for life, yet its efficient use and conservation remain as global challenges. The Sustainable Development Goal seeks to ensure water availability and management for all by 2030. However, about 2.2 billion people lack safe drinking water, and 733 million live in high-stress water regions. With less than 2% of Earth's water being freshwater, and its distribution uneven, water scarcity is a growing issue. By 2050, water supply may drop by 40%, worsening water-related health problems and disasters. Factors like population growth, climate change, pollution, and poor management practices exacerbate the crisis, impacting health, education, and food security. Addressing these issues requires sustainable water management.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Middle East, with its arid climate and limited freshwater resources, faces severe water scarcity. Saudi Arabia, with an annual rainfall of 114 mm and high evapotranspiration rates, struggles with water availability. Reliance on declining groundwater and energy-intensive desalination compounds the problem. Despite lower per capita water use compared to the U.S., Saudi Arabiaâ€™s freshwater resources are critically scarce. The need for a robust conservation strategy is urgent.
            </p>

            <p>
                Currently, Saudi Arabia lacks a comprehensive water conservation strategy, relying on fragmented measures like low-flush toilets and treated wastewater reuse. The Saudi National Water Strategy 2030, introduced by the Ministry of Environment, Water & Agriculture, addresses several objectives but falls short on conservation.
            </p>

            <p>
                Research on water resource conservation in Saudi Arabia is limited, often lacking a unified approach, especially for urban areas like Jubail Industrial City. This study aims to fill this gap by developing sustainable water conservation strategies for JIC and suggesting measures for their implementation. This research will support Saudi Vision 2030, providing insights for policymakers and a foundation for future studies.
            </p>

            <h3><b>Literature Review</b></h3>

            <p>
                Water conservation involves the efficient and responsible use of water resources to reduce waste, preserve supplies, and protect the environment. It encompasses reducing consumption, minimizing loss, and increasing water recycling for a stable supply. The literature also emphasizes the importance of water conservation in meeting essential human needs.

            <h3><b>Study Area</b></h3>

            <p>
                Jubail Industrial City (JIC) is situated along the Arabian/Persian Gulf, approximately 100 km north of Dammam, the capital of the Eastern Province. It is located at an elevation of 12m above sea level and adjacent to the Jubail old town (Balad), which was a small fishing village until 1975. 
            </p>

            <h3><b>Results of the analysis of case studies</b></h3>

            <p>
                This section presents the existing water conservation strategies from three case studies from Kenya, Pakistan, and New Mexico (USA) with relatively dry environmental conditions and freshwater scarcity. The cases are comparatively analyzed, focusing on key themes, challenges, and best practices related to water conservation. Lessons learned from these cases are then applied to JIC, and conclusions are drawn based on the analysis.
            </p>

            <h3><b>Proposed water conservation strategy for JIC</b></h3>

            <p>
                Water conservation strategy refers to a broad set of measures for the efficient management and preservation of water resources to decrease water consumption, curtail waste, and promote sustainable water management practices. This section disuses the components and implementation plan of the proposed water conservation strategy for JIC and other Saudi cities.
            </p>

            <h3><b>Materials and Methods</b></h3>

            <p>
                The integrated water management strategy used in this research, consisting of water audit, process integration and water recycling. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy, two large manufacturing companies based in Victoria, Australia were chosen as case studies.
            </p>
            <p>
                The recruited companies were selected for the following reasons: 
            </p>
            <p>
                1) both use substantial amounts of freshwater in their processes
            </p>
            <p>
                2) the manner of freshwater consumption at each company is different
            </p>

            <h3><b>Results and discussion</b></h3>

            <p>
                A number of irregularities in water use, mostly associated with employees' work practices, were detected during the water audits. These irregularities emanate from work practices performed during manual addition of freshwater into processes, equipment cleaning and general plant cleaning. Since the irregularities in water use were mostly due to employees' work practices, this is best resolved through direct management intervention. 
            </p>

            <h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>

            <p>
                The JIC is a rapidly developing industrial city facing challenges related to water supply and conservation. This paper examined the water conservation measures in JIC, identified key elements of an effective water conservation strategy through three case studies, and proposed measures for implementing a sustainable water conservation strategy for the city. The recommended strategies for conserving water and sustaining water resources in JIC include water conservation, desalination, recycling.
            </p>

            <p>
                The in-series integrated water management strategy deployed here has been effective in systematically identifying possible water conservation opportunities at two large Australian manufacturing companies. Firstly, the water audit completely characterized all water streams found at both companies' production sites leading to the development of the water flow diagram and also identified some operational issues that could impinge on water management.
