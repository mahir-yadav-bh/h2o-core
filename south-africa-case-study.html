            <p>
                South Africa is a perfect nation to apply Mission 2017′s solutions. It serves as a practical example of how the solutions on this site can be effectively combined and implemented.
            </p>

            <p>
                Gauteng, the smallest yet most populous province in South Africa, occupies just 1.5% of the land but houses a quarter of the population. With rapid growth and density, cities like Johannesburg and Pretoria may face water shortages within five years. Nationally, water demand is expected to exceed supply by 2025. Mission 2017 is exploring global water solutions for South Africa, focusing on optimizing agriculture, energy production, and water infrastructure.
            </p>

            <h3><b>Agriculture</b></h3>

            <p>
                Water conservation in South African agriculture relies on international partnerships and information sharing. Over half of the country's water is used for irrigation, including large areas owned by foreign countries that use South Africa's water to grow and export crops.
            </p>

            <p>
                To minimize this trend, Mission 2017 suggests that landowners’ partner with foreign investors in exchange for infrastructure development. For example, in Zambia, 120 smallholders gave up 80% of their land for 25 years in return for irrigation systems. The farmers will regain their land, but the irrigation will last 40 years. Risks include poor practices, corruption, or unmet contract promises. Mission 2017 emphasizes the importance of public input and reliable government oversight in such partnerships.
            </p>

            <p>
                To promote efficient water use, smallholding farmers should receive information on water-saving techniques. In 1997, the Kenya Agricultural Commodity Exchange used ICT to share market data, significantly benefiting participants. Instead of market prices, Mission 2017 suggests sharing technological innovations for water conservation, creating a self-regulatory network. With widespread mobile phone usage in Africa and South Africa's high mobile data usage, this approach is feasible, utilizing text messaging as the preferred communication method.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is recommended that South Africa's government fund the development of an app to help farmers reduce water usage. The app would provide updates on water-saving techniques and allow farmers to input data for future analysis, aiding in water conservation efforts.

            <h3><b>Local Solutions</b></h3>

            <p>
                We suggest a number of changes that can be implemented at the individual farm/small community level.For immediate results, efforts should focus on fertilizer regulation and field modification, with a priority on public health and conservation education. Overuse of fertilizer can contaminate groundwater and cause eutrophication. Mission 2017 recommends deploying small research groups to South African communities to educate citizens on groundwater contamination. This would empower communities to regulate fertilizer use and protect drinking water. A five-year period is suggested for study, protocol development, and identifying the best fertilizers for both agriculture and human health.
            </p>

            <p>
                Leveling fields reduces water use by eliminating uneven elevation, allowing for timed surge flooding instead of constant flooding. Watering at night is ideal to minimize evaporation.
            </p>

            <p>
                Farmers can improve water efficiency by capturing and reusing runoff water and lining irrigation canals. Installing bricks, concrete, or plastic lining can boost efficiency by up to 35%. Mission 2017 suggests deploying teams to rural communities to raise awareness about water loss due to unlined canals. Once informed, local officials, engineers, and citizens can collaborate on implementation. Canal lining is a quick process, with 2000 meters taking just seven days. Government jobs and funding from the World Bank or Public-Private Partnerships could support these efforts. This approach, developed and implemented by South Africans, could also be used for installing purification stations to filter runoff and protect against fertilizer contamination.
            </p>

            <h3><b>Energy from Biofuel</b></h3>

            <p>
                South Africa relies on foreign fuel suppliers, making it vulnerable to price fluctuations. To reduce emissions, legislation now requires fuels to contain 10% bioethanol and 5% biodiesel. However, the impact on water use remains unclear and is a concern.
            </p>

            <p>
                Water availability limits biofuel feedstock selection in South Africa. The Water Research Commission found that even typically water-efficient options like Sweet Sorghum may not always be optimal. Mission 2017 advises evaluating water, CO2, and nitrous oxide footprints for all biofuel projects to select the most efficient feedstocks. The aim is to maximize fuel yield with minimal water use and greenhouse gas emissions. After regional studies, the approach can be scaled up. Mission 2017 also recommends using biomass waste and wastewater to meet biofuel water demands.

            <h3><b>Where to Get Water</b></h3>

            <p>
                Mission 2017 sees aquifers recharged by rain, runoff, and ancient water as the most viable water sources for densely populated areas like Gauteng. Groundwater use is cheaper than building large dams, especially if managed sustainably. Artificial recharge, where runoff is collected and allowed to percolate back into aquifers, is the best method for replenishing unconfined aquifers. Mission 2017 estimates a large artificial recharge system would cost $200-500 million and could be completed by 2020, with funding from mining companies, industry, governments, and the World Bank.
            </p>

            <p>
                South Africa should enhance water recycling from ground and surface sources. By filtering and treating sewage and industrial water, it can be reused for agriculture. Israel, a leader in water recycling and desalination, can serve as a model for similar initiatives in South Africa.
            </p>
            <p>
                South Africa must address the water crisis by adopting more efficient systems. Mission 2017 recommends improvements in agriculture, energy, and water use. Some solutions, like canal lining, can be implemented quickly, while others will take longer. South Africa should consider these recommendations to prevent water shortages.
