            <p>
                Freshwater is a critical yet limited resource, increasingly threatened by human activities. Europeans currently use an average of 3,550 litres of water per capita per day, a figure that continues to rise with income levels. Despite efforts to promote water conservation, these measures fall short of the drastic reductions needed to avoid water shortages, which could profoundly impact our lives in the near future. With growing demands for high-quality freshwater, it is essential to educate the public about sustainable water use and the threats to water quality. One effective strategy for achieving this is through citizen engagement in water issues, particularly through citizen science projects.
            </p>

            <p>
                To explore public awareness of water use and perceptions of water quality threats, we conducted a survey using snowball convenience sampling among 498 individuals across 23 countries. The survey aimed to assess whether participants accurately understood their water usage, what they perceived as the main threats to water quality, and whether they were interested in contributing to improving water quality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our findings revealed that most respondents significantly underestimated their daily water use, especially their indirect water consumption, which is the water used in producing goods and services. Additionally, many participants underestimated the impact of climate change and environmentally harmful practices, such as feeding ducks, on water quality. This underestimation likely stems from a lack of environmental literacy. However, a promising 85% of participants expressed interest in collaborating with scientists to enhance their local water quality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Engaging citizens in water quality improvement initiatives not only promotes environmental and scientific literacy but also has the potential to reduce personal water consumption. This is particularly relevant as the European Union prepares to launch the next iteration of the Water Framework Directive (WFD), which mandates the inclusion of citizens in water monitoring schemes. Citizen involvement is expected to enhance surface water quality, increase public understanding of water-related issues, and contribute to sustainable water use.

            <p>
                Over the past century, the global population has tripled, while freshwater use has increased sixfold, driven by rising incomes and changing food demands. In 2016, global freshwater use by humans already exceeded sustainable levels, with one-fifth of the world's population lacking adequate access to safe drinking water. Population growth will further intensify the pressure on freshwater resources, affecting both the quantity and quality of available water through various global changes.               
            </p>
            <p>
                Threats to water quality are multifaceted, ranging from agricultural practices, such as nutrient pollution and pesticide use, to domestic sources like sewage and industrial pollution. Additionally, climate change is exacerbating these threats by increasing water demand, both for human consumption and for ecosystems. Massive freshwater abstractions for drinking water, irrigation, and power supply have already led to the loss of half the world's wetlands in the twentieth century. As ecosystems face higher water demands under warmer conditions, the need for smart water management becomes increasingly urgent.              
            </p>
            <p>
                When the water needs of ecosystems are factored into water scarcity calculations, many countries previously considered water-abundant, such as those in Western Europe, suddenly become water-scarce. This challenges the misconception that water scarcity is primarily a problem for developing countries.              
            </p>
            <p>
                Effective water management requires a comprehensive approach that considers social and economic factors, including public acceptance, regional culture, investment in water infrastructure, and technological advancements. In 1995, European citizens and environmental organizations demanded cleaner freshwater resources, prompting the European Commission to prioritize water protection. This led to the creation of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) in 2000, which replaced earlier legislation focused solely on chemical standards for water quality. The WFD was the first guideline based on ecological principles, emphasizing the importance of protecting the ecological quality of Europe's water resources.             
            </p>
            <p>
                Citizen engagement is a key component of the WFD's approach to water management. By involving citizens in water quality assessment and solutions, the directive encourages water managers and scientists to invest in outreach initiatives that promote water awareness and collaboration with non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
            </p>

            <p>
                Water awareness encompasses an understanding of daily water use, including direct use for drinking and washing, as well as indirect use in the production of goods and services. It also involves recognizing threats to water quality, such as agricultural runoff, and understanding that freshwater is a finite resource. Engaging citizens in protecting freshwater resources fosters environmentally responsible behaviour, a concept often described as "citizen science."
            </p>
            <p>
                Citizen science involves individuals or groups learning about, monitoring, preserving, and improving local water quality. Various factors, including education, personal experiences, and cultural attitudes, influence a person's water awareness and their willingness to engage in environmental protection efforts.
            </p>
            <p>
                The level of education a person has received is a significant determinant of their environmental values and their awareness of environmental problems. Environmental education, which highlights the impact of human activities on the environment, has been increasingly incorporated into school curricula worldwide. This has likely contributed to higher water awareness among younger age groups.
            </p>
            <p>
                Working in a scientific environment encourages critical thinking and provides a global perspective on environmental issues, further enhancing water awareness. The United Nations' sustainable development goals emphasize the importance of involving women in addressing water quality issues, given their role in daily water use for household and family care. However, gender alone may not predict water awareness, as educational opportunities for women and girls remain limited in some parts of the world.

            <p>
                Rural residents, who often rely on their own water sources, may be more directly aware of water quality issues compared to urban dwellers, who are more disconnected from their water sources. Personal experiences with water scarcity, such as droughts, or water abundance, such as floods, also shape individuals' attitudes towards water. These experiences vary across Europe, with southern Europeans more likely to face chronic water shortages, while northern Europeans are more exposed to flooding.
            </p>
            <p>
                Individuals' perceptions of water—as merely a resource for human survival or as a vital element for all life and ecosystem functioning—can influence their water awareness and their willingness to participate in improving water quality. We hypothesize that participants with higher education, scientific backgrounds, rural upbringing, and a holistic view of water will be more water-aware and more motivated to engage in water quality protection efforts.
            </p>
            
            <h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
            <p>
                In summary, our study highlights the urgent need to improve public understanding of water use and water quality threats. While many Europeans are unaware of the extent of their water consumption, there is significant interest in participating in efforts to protect and improve water resources. Engaging citizens through initiatives like the WFD can enhance environmental literacy, reduce water use, and contribute to sustainable water management across Europe.
