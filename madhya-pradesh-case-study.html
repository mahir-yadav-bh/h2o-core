            <p>
                Water resources, once abundant, are rapidly diminishing under human pressure. In India, despite the milestone of the billionth baby, the government has not taken effective steps to curb population growth. Jabalpur, located in Madhya Pradesh near the Narmada River, has seen its population soar from 700,000 to 2 million in just two decades. This surge has exacerbated water shortages, particularly during the summer, leading to irregular water supply, long queues, and conflicts. The city's lakes, once vital for daily needs and groundwater recharge, are now shrinking, replaced by concrete structures and waste. Plans for new sports and business complexes on these disappearing water bodies disregard their environmental impact.
            </p>

            <p>
                The scarcity of water in Jabalpur has led to widespread digging of tubewells, causing a further decline in the water table. This issue is exacerbated by the neglect of the city's lakes, which require regular cleaning and desilting to help recharge groundwater. Redirecting a portion of funds collected during festivals towards maintaining these water bodies could benefit local wells.
            </p>

            <p>
                Jabalpur's primary water sources are the Narmada River, rainfall, and groundwater. The flow in the Narmada relies on rains in its upper reaches. By harvesting rainwater, households could significantly alleviate the city's water crisis. Large underground water storage tanks could store rainwater and recharge groundwater, and individuals who fail to replenish the groundwater they use should face penalties from the municipality or water board.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition to the Narmada, two reservoirs supply water to the city. In the past, dense forests in the Khandari and Pariyat catchment areas allowed rainwater to recharge groundwater aquifers. However, with the loss of 70% of forest cover in Khandari and 30% in Pariyat, reservoirs are now silting up, reducing their capacity. Despite the growing crisis, there is no official policy in place to address the situation.

            <p>
                Effective water management requires careful planning and coordinated efforts. One proposed solution is the establishment of independent water bodies managed by professionals hired on a contractual basis, whose compensation would be tied to their work efficiency. This would reduce governmental interference and promote accountability. Additionally, banning tubewells could significantly aid in groundwater recharge, helping to address the ongoing depletion.
            </p>

            <p>
                Licensing should be mandatory for every well digger to regulate the practice, and the introduction of high water charges could discourage the misuse of water. Imposing charges based on the volume of water used, with metering at all supply points, would ensure more responsible water consumption. Government gardens could lead by example by implementing sprinkler systems, drip irrigation, and greenhouses to conserve water.
            </p>

            <p>
                During the monsoon season, the Narmada water pipeline could be utilized to recharge ponds within the city, and building activities around lakes should be strictly prohibited to preserve these vital water bodies. Rooftop water harvesting should be made a mandatory requirement, with the registration of new colonies contingent upon the installation of such systems.
            </p>

            <p>
                Furthermore, reforestation should be aggressively promoted across the state, avoiding high water-consuming trees like Eucalyptus. The disposal of polluted water from industrial areas should be carefully managed to prevent contamination of rivers downstream, ensuring that water sources remain safe and sustainable for future use.
            </p>
