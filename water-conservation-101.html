                Hello, Adventurers! Today, we’ll be talking about the importance of water conservation and how you can help. If you are interested in learning about how and why you should participate in water conservation efforts, you’ve come to the right place! Let’s get started.
            </p>
            <p>
                Water conservation refers to the careful use and preservation of water resources to avoid water scarcity and ensure the availability of water for future generations. Water is the Earth’s most plentiful natural resource, and it is a renewable resource, meaning it replenishes itself to replace what was used or depleted. So, if water is a renewable resource, why do we need to conserve it? While it is true that the Earth will never run out of water, water moves through what is known as the water cycle, and each stage takes different amounts of time to complete. The water cycle is also known as the hydrologic cycle, and consists of the evaporation, condensation, and precipitation of surface runoff that keeps the Earth’s water supply in constant flow. If too much water is used up in one place, it can take longer for it to replenish. This means that local water supplies can potentially run dry due to overuse. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, fresh water suitable for human consumption only makes up a small percentage of the Earth’s water supply. To be precise, only about three percent of the Earth’s water is freshwater, and about 1.2 percent of that can be used as drinking water. Most of the water we drink comes from rivers and streams. 97% of the Earth’s water is found in the oceans and is too salty to drink or use for growing crops. In the U.S., the average family uses more than 300 gallons of water per day. A significant amount of water is used to grow crops, manufacture goods, and meet the nation’s energy needs. To put it simply, we couldn’t exist without water– It is an essential part of life for all organisms, including humans. 
            </p>
            <p>
                But what is causing the water crisis? One reason is climate change. Climate change disrupts weather patterns, thus leading to unpredictable weather events and water availability. As the Earth gets warmer, the amount of precipitation in many areas lessens. As mentioned above, this interferes with the water cycle, making it take longer for water sources to replenish themselves. Rising temperatures can also lead to deadly pathogens contaminating fresh water sources, putting millions of people at risk. Also due to climate change, droughts have become more frequent– South Carolina has experienced a number of droughts in recent years, with the worst occurring in 2008. Drought conditions in multiple counties within the state reached a “severe” level in 2011, with precipitation, groundwater levels, and stream flows dropping to or near record lows. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Pollution also contributes to water scarcity. Water pollution can come from pesticides and fertilizers that are washed away from farms and industrial waste. It is estimated that 2 million tons of sewage and other effluents drain into the world’s water every day. Many pollutants can penetrate underground, contaminating groundwater. Polluted water cannot be used for drinking, bathing, or agriculture, so this dramatically reduces the amount of useable water within a given area.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another element contributing to the water crisis is the growth of the population. As populations grow, so does the demand and need for water. According to the United Nations, the world population is estimated to reach 9.8 billion by the year 2050. Already, 1.1 billion people worldwide lack access to water. If we don’t act now to conserve our water supply, that number will grow exceptionally fast. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When reservoir water levels drop, water supplies, human health, and the environment are put at risk. This means that lakes, rivers, and streams will have less water available, and that can be a problem for wildlife that utilizes those water sources to survive. So how can you do your part to conserve water? There are a variety of easy ways that you can make a difference!

            <h3><b>Saving Water Indoors</b></h3>
            <p>
                Do you have a leaky faucet? It is sometimes impossible to avoid, but when it happens, the sooner you fix it, the better. A small leak can add up to gallons of water lost every day! In fact, household leaks can waste nearly 1 trillion gallons of water annually nationwide. Checking your plumbing systems frequently can help you identify leaks faster, and fixing them early not only saves water but also saves you money!                
            </p>
            <p>
                Over half of all water use inside of the home takes place in the bathroom, and water is also widely used in the kitchen. Some ways you can cut down on your water use in the bathroom and kitchen are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth</li>
                    <li>Shower instead of taking a bath, and try to reduce your shower time by one minute each week</li>
                    <li>Install water-saving showerheads or flow restrictors</li>
                    <li>Double-check that the faucet is completely off before leaving the room</li>
                    <li>Turn the water off while washing dishes– And let them soak if needed</li>
                </ul>              
            </p>
            <h3><b>Saving Water Outside</b></h3>
            <p>
                There are also steps you can take to conserve water use outside in your yard:              
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Water your lawn only when it needs it</li>
                    <li>Position sprinklers so that the water lands on your lawn or garden, not on the sidewalk or other areas that don’t need to be watered</li>
                    <li>Put a layer of mulch around trees and plants to slow the evaporation of moisture</li>
                    <li>Washing your car? Turn off the hose and use a bucket full of soapy water instead</li>
                    <li>Put out a water basin to catch rainwater, and then use it to water your plants </li>
                </ul>              
            </p>
