                In recent years, Rajasthan, one of India’s driest states with average annual rainfall as low as 100 mm in its western parts and temperatures soaring to 48°C, has seen improvements in water management through the revival of ancient conservation techniques. Known for the Thar Desert, Rajasthan has a rich history of water conservation methods adapted over centuries to combat water scarcity. These traditional systems are experiencing a resurgence, offering promising solutions to the state’s water challenges.
            </p>

            <p>
                One notable revival is the "paar," an ancient rainwater harvesting technique. The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) has supported this revival through its small grants program, collaborating with the Thar Integrated Social Development Society (TISDS). Between 2003 and 2008, the "paar" system was successfully reinstated in Jaisalmer district, significantly improving water availability for local villages. If this trend continues, it holds potential for further alleviating water shortages in Rajasthan.
            </p>

            <p>
                An ancient water conservation technique making a comeback in Rajasthan is the "johad," an earthen check dam designed to capture rainwater. This method enhances groundwater recharge by improving percolation. Tarun Bharat Sangh, an NGO, has successfully implemented johads in Alwar district, one of the state's poorest areas. Since the late 1980s, this initiative has significantly improved water security through effective rainwater harvesting.

            <p>
                These traditional methods are poised to increase water security in Rajasthan's rural areas, which have historically lacked modern water conservation technologies. For instance, in Jodhpur district, existing and proposed traditional techniques could secure up to 68 MCM of water, potentially serving 70% of the population. The success of projects like those in Alwar and Jaisalmer could encourage NGOs to expand these techniques across the state. Traditional methods are also cost-effective, offering a high water yield for a low investment. The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has highlighted water harvesting in its Vision 2022 document for Rajasthan, potentially increasing funding and support for such initiatives. With backing from NGOs and corporate entities, the government is likely to engage more deeply in these efforts. The revival of ancient techniques is expected to positively impact groundwater levels and mitigate desertification, as demonstrated by the johad projects in Alwar, which resulted in a 6-meter rise in groundwater tables and a 33% increase in forest cover.
            </p>

            <p>
                The revival of ancient water conservation techniques in Rajasthan has the potential to significantly impact various aspects of life in the state. Traditionally, young girls in Rajasthan have been kept out of school to travel long distances to fetch water for their families. By improving local water security through methods like johads and paar, these girls could stay in school, as the time required for water collection decreases. This shift would also enable older women to engage more in economic activities and education.

            <p>
                Furthermore, the preservation and use of traditional water techniques will help maintain valuable cultural knowledge and practices. Increased water security could enhance food security in villages and reduce the need for migration, as improved agricultural productivity might mitigate the economic necessity for labour migration.
            </p>

            <p>
                Rajasthan's vulnerability to climate change—evidenced by erratic rainfall, flash floods, and prolonged droughts—highlights the urgency of adopting effective water management strategies. By integrating ancient techniques with modern practices, the state can better prepare for and adapt to the impacts of climate change, securing a more stable and sustainable future.
