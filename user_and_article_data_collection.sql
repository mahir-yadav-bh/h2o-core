(1, 'Ananshi Sharma', 'ananshi.sharma.24cse@bmu.edu.in', 'India', 'Haryana', 'Gurugram', 'Mahu', 'Making Every Drop Count', 'Today, many countries face severe pressure on water resources resulting from a complex array of factors, including inadequate planning, inefficient systems, failures to recover the costs of providing this vital resource, and the accelerating effects of climate change. On the demand side of the equation, this means the world must manage water more efficiently.\n\nIn Indonesia, one of the top rice producers in the world, agriculture uses 80% of the country’s water. Small-scale irrigation continues to play an important role in production, with more than 20% of farmers—often from the poorest parts of society—using this type of system. About 40% of Indonesia’s 7.2 million hectares of irrigated land uses small-scale systems, making this method an important contributor to reducing poverty, improving food security, and supporting livelihoods.\n\nBut many of these systems, despite past investments aimed at achieving rice self-sufficiency, have fallen into neglect. In 2014, roughly 46% of irrigation systems in Indonesia were in poor condition, and almost 90,000 hectares of irrigated land are converted to other purposes every year. Although there have been improvements in recent years, the growth of national rice production, coupled with infrastructure damage and limited budgets for maintenance, has led to a vicious cycle of “build, neglect, and rebuild,” poor performance, and low productivity.\n\nIndonesia has undergone an important shift in its water and irrigation sector toward a decentralized and strengthened system of service delivery. Local governments are now primarily responsible for the management of these systems, but they face huge capacity and resource challenges. This is compounded by Indonesia’s geography—as the world’s largest archipelagic country, there are more than 500 local governments on nearly 13,500 islands, making service delivery particularly challenging.\n\nLocal governments rely on fiscal transfers from the central government toward operations and maintenance services in irrigation schemes, but increasing investment in one irrigation scheme reduces allocations for other schemes, which could result in infrastructure disparities. Local government-owned irrigation infrastructure is also deteriorating at a rate of between 5% and 10% each year, which compounds the problem. Allocating resources toward a particular irrigation scheme at the expense of another is a difficult decision that requires weighing up the investment against efficiency and equitable distribution concerns.\n\nThe World Bank is working with the government of Indonesia to explore how local governments&#039; support can deliver better results and quality in irrigation systems. At a recent workshop, the Indonesian Ministry of National Development Planning, the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Public Works and Housing worked with the World Bank’s Water Global Practice to examine how performance-based instruments can be used to guide investment decisions and make small-scale irrigation more sustainable and financially viable.\n\nThe World Bank has a wealth of knowledge on how results-based financing can be used to incentivize local governments to improve the quality of their service delivery, but these experiences have predominantly operated across other sectors, such as water supply, transport, and solid waste management. This has led to many good practices which can be applied to small-scale irrigation. Replicating this instrument to irrigation might provide similar incentives to local governments to improve the quality of irrigation service delivery.\n\nThe World Bank is supporting the government of Indonesia’s National Urban Water Supply Project, which provides results-based fiscal transfers to local water companies. This innovative solution incentivizes utilities to improve their services and is having a substantial impact, provided it is implemented alongside capacity building for local stakeholders, with clear agreements on performance indicators and monitoring. This approach is also most successful when aligned with a government’s budget cycle and systems.\n\nThe efficient use of small-scale irrigation can significantly improve income and food security for Indonesia’s people. By strengthening performance-based fund transfers to local governments, small-scale irrigation can play a major role in the efforts to alleviate poverty, bolster water security, and build climate resilience.', 'https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/water/making-every-drop-count--rebuilding-small-scale-irrigation-in-in'),
(2, 'Isha Arjaria', 'isha.arjaria.24cse@bmu.edu.in', 'India', 'Haryana', 'Gurugram', '', 'How is India Tackling Its Water Needs', 'Come summer, and water becomes a commodity as precious as gold in India. The country has 18 percent of the world’s population, but only 4 percent of its water resources, making it among the most water-stressed in the world. A large number of Indians face high to extreme water stress, according to a recent report by the government’s policy think tank, the NITI Aayog. India’s dependence on an increasingly erratic monsoon for its water requirements increases this challenge. Climate change is likely to exacerbate this pressure on water resources, even as the frequency and intensity on floods and droughts in the country increases.\r\n\r\nThe World Bank is engaged in different aspects of water resource management and the supply of drinking water and sanitation services across the country. Here are some of the ways how.\r\n\r\nStemming Groundwater Depletion\r\nGroundwater is one of the most important sources for irrigation as well as for rural and urban domestic water supply. However, overexploitation of this valuable resource has led to its depletion.\r\n\r\nThe World Bank is helping the supporting the government’s national groundwater program, the Atal Bhujal Yojana, to help improve groundwater management. Implemented in 8,220 gram panchayats across seven Indian states, this is the world’s largest community-led groundwater management program. Since groundwater conservation lies in the hands of hundreds of millions of individuals and communities, the program is helping villagers understand their water availability and usage patterns so they can budget their water use accordingly.\r\n\r\nIn the agrarian state of Punjab, where rampant tubewell irrigation is causing the water table to fall drastically, the Bank helped the state government pilot an innovative scheme to conserve groundwater.\r\n\r\nThe “Paani Bachao, Paisa Kamao” (Save Water, Earn Money) scheme incentivizes farmers to reduce groundwater usage. Around 300 enrolled farmers were given cash incentives to save electricity used for irrigation, resulting in water savings of between 6 and 25 percent without any adverse effect on the yield.\r\n\r\nReaching the underserved in India’s villages\r\nOver the last decade, the World Bank has supported the government’s efforts to bring clean drinking water to rural communities. A range of projects with a total financing of $1.2 billion have benefitted over 20 million people.\r\n\r\nVillages in the mountain state of Uttarakhand, suffered from a lack of water supply as the steep Himalayan terrain made it difficult to build and maintain the required infrastructure. For many villagers, particularly women, obtaining fresh water for domestic use meant traveling distances of over 1.6 kilometres.\r\n\r\nBetween 2006-15 the World Bank-financed Uttarakhand Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project helped over 1.57 million people in the state by improving sustainable rural water supply and sanitation services across underserved areas. The project focussed on building infrastructure and institutional capacity, including that of the village communities, that would be resilient from natural disasters in the mountain state that often experiences flash-floods, earthquakes and landslides.\r\n\r\nThe southern state of Kerala receives one of the highest levels of rainfall in the country, however, its undulating terrain drains most of the rainwater into the sea. Rapid growth of built-up areas across the state has led to depleting water sources.\r\n\r\nSince the early 2000s, the World Bank has been supporting the state government in ensuring that rural families receive a dependable supply of piped water in their homes, at a price that even low-income households can afford. Jalanidhi I (2000-2008) and Jalanidhi II (2012-2017) have helped bring water into village homes by putting local communities in charge of managing their own water supply schemes for the first time in their lives.\r\n\r\nReliable Water Supply to Cities\r\nContinuous piped water supply has been a pipe dream for fast-urbanizing Indian cities. Most urban households receive water for a couple of hours a day at most, and often only on a few days a week. This particularly affects the poor, women and children, who spend time and money securing water for their daily needs.\r\n\r\nThe southern state of Karnataka has now proved that 24/7 water supply is indeed possible, affordable, and sustainable in urban areas. The World Bank-supported Karnataka Water Supply Improvement Project helped pilot this approach in the three-water stressed cities of Hubbali-Dharwad, Belagavi and Kalaburgi; a follow-on project, the Karnataka Urban Water Supply Modernization Project, is now scaling up to cover the entire population of the three cities.\r\n\r\nEven as citizens are required to pay for the water they use, the tariff for “lifeline consumption”— up to 8 kilo litres —is kept at levels that poorer households can afford. Household-level water connections are subsidized to ensure poorer households can avail of the improved services.\r\n\r\nThe story is similar in Shimla, capital of the hill state of Himachal Pradesh. Declining water sources, rapid population growth and increasing numbers of tourists to the resort town meant that the city received water for a few hours every three days. Improvements brought about under the Shimla Water Supply and Sewerage Service Delivery Reform Project have ensured that the city now receives at least 3-4 hours of water supply every day and efforts are on to move to 24x7 supply. All this has been achieved not just by fixing the pipes but by fixing the institutions that fix the pipes. The World Bank project supported the establishment of a professionally run water utility that is directly accountable to citizens.\r\n\r\nIn Punjab, where groundwater levels are reaching critical levels, the Punjab Municipal Services Improvement Project is helping two large cities shift to surface water sources, like from local canals. The improvements in the water supply are expected to benefit more than 3 million people by 2026 and an estimated 5 million projected population by 2055.\r\n\r\nIn 2019 the southern metropolis of Chennai reeled under a severe water crisis and water was brought in by train from some 200 kilometres away to save the city. Today, Chennai has become the first Indian city to recycle its wastewater at scale to meet the non-drinking water needs of its industries. One completed, two Tertiary Treatment Reverse Osmosis (TTRO) plants will be able to recycle about 20 percent of Chennai’s sewage, enabling the city to reduce its consumption of fresh water.\r\n\r\nManaging India&#039;s Most Iconic River\r\nThe Ganga is India&#039;s most important and iconic river and is worshipped by millions as a living goddess. However, the Ganga today is facing formidable pressures of rapid urbanization along its banks as over 100 towns and cities pour their domestic sewage into the river.\r\n\r\nThe World Bank has been supporting the Government of India’s efforts to rejuvenate the Ganga River since 2011. Two World Bank projects, worth $1 billion, are helping set up the institutions needed to manage the river and build the infrastructure to keep it clean. Sewage from cities is the biggest source of organic pollution in the Ganga. By building and maintaining sewage treatment plants and a network of drains, sewage water from houses in several of these cities now gets treated before reaching the river.\r\n\r\nMaking Irrigation more Predictable\r\nRainfed agriculture in India is a risky enterprise, owing to uncertainties in rainfall, coupled with periodic dry spells and heavy cyclones and floods during the monsoon season. Agriculture is hardly possible during the non-monsoon season without irrigation facilities.\r\n\r\nOver the last 50 years, India has invested substantially in infrastructure necessary to usher irrigated agriculture to vast areas all over the country. Minor irrigation schemes are benefiting small and marginal farmers in particular. A World Bank project in the remote rain-fed western region of West Bengal has helped farmers from disadvantaged tribal communities build small irrigation facilities. Farmers now harvest two crops each year and are no longer leaving their villages in search of work elsewhere.\r\n\r\nA Major Irrigation and Flood Management Project in West Bengal is helping 2.7 million farmers access better irrigation services and improved protection against annual flooding to mitigate the impact of climate change. By optimizing the use of surface and ground water and strengthening flood management, the project is helping boost agricultural productivity and increase incomes in rural areas.\r\n\r\nTracking Floods and Droughts\r\nIndia is prone to droughts as well as floods even as climate change is increasing unpredictability in weather patterns and leading to more extreme weather events. Reservoirs can help mitigate these extreme events by storing water and releasing it when needed. However, reservoir operators often do not have the technological tools to help them take crucial decisions that can avoid floods.\r\n\r\nTwo World Bank-supported hydrology projects have introduced new systems and technology that give reservoir managers an accurate picture of the water situation unfolding in their region. These systems have laid the foundation for a comprehensive knowledge base that can improve the overall management of water resources in the country. These systems can also help alleviate the harshest impact of droughts. Water resources monitoring system is now getting expanded to cover the entire country, including the Indus, Ganga, and Brahmaputra-Barak River basins.', 'https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/india/brief/world-water-day-2022-how-india-is-addressing-its-water-needs'),
(3, 'Divisha Goel', 'divisha.goel.24cse@bmu.edu.in', 'India', 'Haryana', 'Gurugram', '', 'Water Saving 101', 'Hello, Adventurers! Today, we’ll be talking about the importance of water conservation and how you can help. If you are interested in learning about how and why you should participate in water conservation efforts, you’ve come to the right place! Let’s get started.\r\n\r\nWater conservation refers to the careful use and preservation of water resources to avoid water scarcity and ensure the availability of water for future generations. Water is the Earth’s most plentiful natural resource, and it is a renewable resource, meaning it replenishes itself to replace what was used or depleted. So, if water is a renewable resource, why do we need to conserve it? While it is true that the Earth will never run out of water, water moves through what is known as the water cycle, and each stage takes different amounts of time to complete. The water cycle is also known as the hydrologic cycle, and consists of the evaporation, condensation, and precipitation of surface runoff that keeps the Earth’s water supply in constant flow. If too much water is used up in one place, it can take longer for it to replenish. This means that local water supplies can potentially run dry due to overuse.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, fresh water suitable for human consumption only makes up a small percentage of the Earth’s water supply. To be precise, only about three percent of the Earth’s water is freshwater, and about 1.2 percent of that can be used as drinking water. Most of the water we drink comes from rivers and streams. 97% of the Earth’s water is found in the oceans and is too salty to drink or use for growing crops. In the U.S., the average family uses more than 300 gallons of water per day. A significant amount of water is used to grow crops, manufacture goods, and meet the nation’s energy needs. To put it simply, we couldn’t exist without water– It is an essential part of life for all organisms, including humans.\r\n\r\nBut what is causing the water crisis? One reason is climate change. Climate change disrupts weather patterns, thus leading to unpredictable weather events and water availability. As the Earth gets warmer, the amount of precipitation in many areas lessens. As mentioned above, this interferes with the water cycle, making it take longer for water sources to replenish themselves. Rising temperatures can also lead to deadly pathogens contaminating fresh water sources, putting millions of people at risk. Also due to climate change, droughts have become more frequent– South Carolina has experienced a number of droughts in recent years, with the worst occurring in 2008. Drought conditions in multiple counties within the state reached a “severe” level in 2011, with precipitation, groundwater levels, and stream flows dropping to or near record lows.\r\n\r\nPollution also contributes to water scarcity. Water pollution can come from pesticides and fertilizers that are washed away from farms and industrial waste. It is estimated that 2 million tons of sewage and other effluents drain into the world’s water every day. Many pollutants can penetrate underground, contaminating groundwater. Polluted water cannot be used for drinking, bathing, or agriculture, so this dramatically reduces the amount of useable water within a given area.\r\n\r\nAnother element contributing to the water crisis is the growth of the population. As populations grow, so does the demand and need for water. According to the United Nations, the world population is estimated to reach 9.8 billion by the year 2050. Already, 1.1 billion people worldwide lack access to water. If we don’t act now to conserve our water supply, that number will grow exceptionally fast.\r\n\r\nWhen reservoir water levels drop, water supplies, human health, and the environment are put at risk. This means that lakes, rivers, and streams will have less water available, and that can be a problem for wildlife that utilizes those water sources to survive. So how can you do your part to conserve water? There are a variety of easy ways that you can make a difference!\r\n\r\nSaving Water Indoors\r\nDo you have a leaky faucet? It is sometimes impossible to avoid, but when it happens, the sooner you fix it, the better. A small leak can add up to gallons of water lost every day! In fact, household leaks can waste nearly 1 trillion gallons of water annually nationwide. Checking your plumbing systems frequently can help you identify leaks faster, and fixing them early not only saves water but also saves you money!\r\n\r\nOver half of all water use inside of the home takes place in the bathroom, and water is also widely used in the kitchen. Some ways you can cut down on your water use in the bathroom and kitchen are:\r\n\r\nTurn off the faucet while brushing your teeth\r\nShower instead of taking a bath, and try to reduce your shower time by one minute each week\r\nInstall water-saving showerheads or flow restrictors\r\nDouble-check that the faucet is completely off before leaving the room\r\nTurn the water off while washing dishes– And let them soak if needed\r\nSaving Water Outside\r\nThere are also steps you can take to conserve water use outside in your yard:\r\n\r\nWater your lawn only when it needs it\r\nPosition sprinklers so that the water lands on your lawn or garden, not on the sidewalk or other areas that don’t need to be watered\r\nPut a layer of mulch around trees and plants to slow the evaporation of moisture\r\nWashing your car? Turn off the hose and use a bucket full of soapy water instead\r\nPut out a water basin to catch rainwater, and then use it to water your plants', 'https://www.coastalexpeditions.com/blog/water-conservation-101/'),
(4, 'Manasvi Bansal', 'manasvi.bansal.24cse@bmu.edu.in', 'India', 'Haryana', '', '', 'Saving Water for Future', 'Freshwater is a critical yet limited resource, increasingly threatened by human activities. Europeans currently use an average of 3,550 litres of water per capita per day, a figure that continues to rise with income levels. Despite efforts to promote water conservation, these measures fall short of the drastic reductions needed to avoid water shortages, which could profoundly impact our lives in the near future. With growing demands for high-quality freshwater, it is essential to educate the public about sustainable water use and the threats to water quality. One effective strategy for achieving this is through citizen engagement in water issues, particularly through citizen science projects.\r\n\r\nTo explore public awareness of water use and perceptions of water quality threats, we conducted a survey using snowball convenience sampling among 498 individuals across 23 countries. The survey aimed to assess whether participants accurately understood their water usage, what they perceived as the main threats to water quality, and whether they were interested in contributing to improving water quality.\r\n\r\nOur findings revealed that most respondents significantly underestimated their daily water use, especially their indirect water consumption, which is the water used in producing goods and services. Additionally, many participants underestimated the impact of climate change and environmentally harmful practices, such as feeding ducks, on water quality. This underestimation likely stems from a lack of environmental literacy. However, a promising 85% of participants expressed interest in collaborating with scientists to enhance their local water quality.\r\n\r\nEngaging citizens in water quality improvement initiatives not only promotes environmental and scientific literacy but also has the potential to reduce personal water consumption. This is particularly relevant as the European Union prepares to launch the next iteration of the Water Framework Directive (WFD), which mandates the inclusion of citizens in water monitoring schemes. Citizen involvement is expected to enhance surface water quality, increase public understanding of water-related issues, and contribute to sustainable water use.\r\n\r\nOver the past century, the global population has tripled, while freshwater use has increased sixfold, driven by rising incomes and changing food demands. In 2016, global freshwater use by humans already exceeded sustainable levels, with one-fifth of the world&#039;s population lacking adequate access to safe drinking water. Population growth will further intensify the pressure on freshwater resources, affecting both the quantity and quality of available water through various global changes.\r\n\r\nThreats to water quality are multifaceted, ranging from agricultural practices, such as nutrient pollution and pesticide use, to domestic sources like sewage and industrial pollution. Additionally, climate change is exacerbating these threats by increasing water demand, both for human consumption and for ecosystems. Massive freshwater abstractions for drinking water, irrigation, and power supply have already led to the loss of half the world&#039;s wetlands in the twentieth century. As ecosystems face higher water demands under warmer conditions, the need for smart water management becomes increasingly urgent.\r\n\r\nWhen the water needs of ecosystems are factored into water scarcity calculations, many countries previously considered water-abundant, such as those in Western Europe, suddenly become water-scarce. This challenges the misconception that water scarcity is primarily a problem for developing countries.\r\n\r\nEffective water management requires a comprehensive approach that considers social and economic factors, including public acceptance, regional culture, investment in water infrastructure, and technological advancements. In 1995, European citizens and environmental organizations demanded cleaner freshwater resources, prompting the European Commission to prioritize water protection. This led to the creation of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) in 2000, which replaced earlier legislation focused solely on chemical standards for water quality. The WFD was the first guideline based on ecological principles, emphasizing the importance of protecting the ecological quality of Europe&#039;s water resources.\r\n\r\nCitizen engagement is a key component of the WFD&#039;s approach to water management. By involving citizens in water quality assessment and solutions, the directive encourages water managers and scientists to invest in outreach initiatives that promote water awareness and collaboration with non-governmental organizations (NGOs).\r\n\r\nWater awareness encompasses an understanding of daily water use, including direct use for drinking and washing, as well as indirect use in the production of goods and services. It also involves recognizing threats to water quality, such as agricultural runoff, and understanding that freshwater is a finite resource. Engaging citizens in protecting freshwater resources fosters environmentally responsible behaviour, a concept often described as &quot;citizen science.&quot;\r\n\r\nCitizen science involves individuals or groups learning about, monitoring, preserving, and improving local water quality. Various factors, including education, personal experiences, and cultural attitudes, influence a person&#039;s water awareness and their willingness to engage in environmental protection efforts.\r\n\r\nThe level of education a person has received is a significant determinant of their environmental values and their awareness of environmental problems. Environmental education, which highlights the impact of human activities on the environment, has been increasingly incorporated into school curricula worldwide. This has likely contributed to higher water awareness among younger age groups.\r\n\r\nWorking in a scientific environment encourages critical thinking and provides a global perspective on environmental issues, further enhancing water awareness. The United Nations&#039; sustainable development goals emphasize the importance of involving women in addressing water quality issues, given their role in daily water use for household and family care. However, gender alone may not predict water awareness, as educational opportunities for women and girls remain limited in some parts of the world.\r\n\r\nRural residents, who often rely on their own water sources, may be more directly aware of water quality issues compared to urban dwellers, who are more disconnected from their water sources. Personal experiences with water scarcity, such as droughts, or water abundance, such as floods, also shape individuals&#039; attitudes towards water. These experiences vary across Europe, with southern Europeans more likely to face chronic water shortages, while northern Europeans are more exposed to flooding.\r\n\r\nIndividuals&#039; perceptions of water—as merely a resource for human survival or as a vital element for all life and ecosystem functioning—can influence their water awareness and their willingness to participate in improving water quality. We hypothesize that participants with higher education, scientific backgrounds, rural upbringing, and a holistic view of water will be more water-aware and more motivated to engage in water quality protection efforts.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nIn summary, our study highlights the urgent need to improve public understanding of water use and water quality threats. While many Europeans are unaware of the extent of their water consumption, there is significant interest in participating in efforts to protect and improve water resources. Engaging citizens through initiatives like the WFD can enhance environmental literacy, reduce water use, and contribute to sustainable water management across Europe.', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301479719305043');
